### About myself:
The world is developing very quickly and the model of education of the last century is simply outdated. Now the model of education is "study or be at the bottom." I want to spend this year on acquiring new knowledge as a result of new opportunities, a new community, a new round of self-development. I think that schooling will give me answers and tools to my previous requests.
